# Fueled-mini-project
it's based on the calorie counter project freecodecamp . I made it because i didn't feel comfortable with literal templates, regex, and some other functions so i decided to get some practice...
i faced some defficulties with my laptop but now that i have fixed it i'm back in the game....
